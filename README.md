## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8+
- Maven
- MySQL

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   `git clone https://github.com/kanikaprabhakar/Online-Exam-App.git`

2. **Configure MySQL**  
   - Create a database named `EXAM_APP`.
   - Update credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

3. **Build the project**  
   `mvn clean install`

4. **Run the application**  
   `mvn spring-boot:run`
